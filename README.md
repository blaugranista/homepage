### Opis ###

This page is my first ever. Someone used to give me codes, but that was a long time ago and I wasn't very interested. Now, years later, I saw an appearance on the program for a change and building my "other" safety zone. He gives his best and writes the code not only looks legible through the page, but also so that by the person watching the construction stages of the project everything was as childish as possible.
On the page I used the attributes that occur during the course. Nomenclature, basic classification using BEM, interactions using JavaScript.
